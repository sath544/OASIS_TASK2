# Customer Segmentation Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. These insights can help inform targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall business strategies.  

## Key Objectives  

- **Data Collection**:  
  Use a dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and related data.  

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:  
  Understand dataset structure and handle missing or inconsistent data.  

- **Descriptive Statistics**:  
  Calculate metrics such as average purchase value, purchase frequency, etc.  

- **Customer Segmentation**:  
  Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to group customers based on behavior and purchase patterns.  

- **Visualization**:  
  Use scatter plots, bar charts, and other visualizations to illustrate customer segments.  

- **Insights and Recommendations**:  
  Provide actionable insights based on segment characteristics to guide business decisions.  

## Tools and Libraries  

**Programming Language**: Python  

**Libraries**:  
- pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.  
- numpy: For numerical operations and descriptive statistics.  
- matplotlib & seaborn: For creating static visualizations.  
- sklearn: For implementing clustering algorithms like K-means.  
- plotly: For interactive visualizations.  

## Learning Outcomes  

- Gain hands-on experience with clustering algorithms like K-means.  
- Develop proficiency in data cleaning and exploration techniques.  
- Learn to create impactful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.  
- Understand how customer segmentation can influence business strategies.  

## Steps Performed

3. **Descriptive Statistics**:  
   Calculated key customer metrics, including average purchase value and frequency.  

4. **Clustering**:  
   Applied K-means clustering to segment customers based on behavioral patterns.  

5. **Visualization**:  
   Created scatter plots, bar charts, and other visualizations to illustrate customer segments.  

6. **Insights and Recommendations**:  
   Analyzed segment characteristics and provided actionable recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.
